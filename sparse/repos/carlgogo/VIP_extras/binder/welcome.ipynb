    "\n",
    "- loading datasets\n",
    "- pre-processing\n",
    "- post-processing with ADI algorithms (Median subtraction, PCA, LLSG, ...)\n",
    "- fake planet injection\n",
    "- flux estimation (NEGFC) \n",
    "- contrast curves, S/N maps\n",

    "This tutorial shows how VIP's `HCIDataset` can be used for simple object-oriented access to all dataset related operations. It covers:\n",
